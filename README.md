# mycode

Working on a python class. Need to learn how to use git. I'm too old to have this available back when I learned to code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project
on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in
how to install Python and Python3 using apt.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
